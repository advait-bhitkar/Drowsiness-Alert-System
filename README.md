# Drowsiness Alert System
 
The Drowsiness Alert App is a life-saving mobile application designed and developed to enhance road safety. Using real-time facial recognition technology, this app detects signs of drowsiness in drivers and alerts them, effectively reducing the risk of accidents and promoting safer driving habits.

## Features
**Real-Time Drowsiness Detection:** The app continuously monitors the driver's face and uses computer vision to detect signs of drowsiness in real-time.

**Alert Mechanism:** When drowsiness is detected, the app triggers an alert, such as an alarm or visual warning, to notify the driver to stay alert.

**Safety First:** Prioritizes the safety of both the driver and other road users, contributing to accident prevention.

**Data Analysis:** Collects data on drowsiness events, which can be used for further analysis and insights.

**User Authentication:** Utilizes Firebase for secure user authentication.

## Tech Stack
The Drowsiness Alert App is built using the following technologies:

**Python:** The core drowsiness detection logic is implemented in Python.

**OpenCV:** OpenCV is used for computer vision tasks, such as facial landmark detection and image processing.

**TensorFlow:** TensorFlow is used for training and deploying the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for drowsiness detection.

**Android & Kotlin:** The mobile app interface is developed using Android and Kotlin.

**Firebase:** Firebase is used for user authentication, ensuring secure access to the app's features.
